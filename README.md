## About me ðŸ‘‹

Hello! Iâ€™m Ankur, a self-taught AI & Machine Learning Developer with strong hands-on experience building intelligent systems using Python, LLMs, and knowledge graphs.

Despite having no formal degree in this field, Iâ€™ve learned everything through practice, real-world problem-solving, and countless hours with docs, repos, and experiments.

ðŸ”§ **What I work with:**
- **Languages & Tools**: Python, SQL, LangChain, LangGraph, FastAPI
- **AI & ML**: LLM integration (OpenAI, HuggingFace), Transformers (Encoder-Decoder), Fine-tuning, RAG, Chatbots
- **Data Systems**: Neo4j (Graph DB), DeepLake, vector stores (FAISS, Qdrant), Pandas, NumPy
- **Architecture & Projects**: Multi-agent pipelines, Knowledge-Graph based reasoning, custom scriptable modules
- **Platforms**: Google Colab, VS Code

ðŸ“¦ Iâ€™ve built:
- AI-native pipelines for industrial intelligence
- Credit Card Fraud Detection systems
- XLRE ETF Analysis with PCA, SVD, and time-series modeling
- Multi-agent RAG systems using LangGraph

ðŸ§  I learn by doing â€” not by memorizing syntax, but by reading documentation, breaking systems, and building them again from scratch.

ðŸŽ¯ **My goal**: To work remotely with teams or clients who value curiosity, fast learning, and clean, scalable AI solutions.
